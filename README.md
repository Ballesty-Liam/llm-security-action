Secure your Gen-AI codebase in **one line**.  
Professional LLM security scanning for production AI applications:

| üîê **API Key Security** | Detects leaked API keys & high-entropy tokens for common LLM/ML providers. Warns the build on any hit.                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚ö° **Rate Limit Heuristic** | Warns when LLM calls appear in loops without appropriate delay (`sleep`, retry, etc.). Flags short or missing delays only if actual LLM API calls are detected. _Warn-only_ by default.                          |
| üõ°Ô∏è **Input Sanitization** | Identifies unsanitized or tainted user input flowing into LLM API calls using AST-based analysis. Detects tainted f-strings, constant injection patterns, and unsafe variable propagation. _Warn-only_ by default. |

No secrets required ‚Äì uses the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Quick Start

```yaml
# .github/workflows/llm-security.yml
name: LLM Agent Trust Verification

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # 1) Check out the code that you want to scan
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2) Run the LLM security Action
      - name: LLM Policy Scan
        uses: Ballesty-Liam/llm-security-action@v1
```

That's it! The action will run on every push and PR, scanning your code for LLM security vulnerabilities.

## üèÜ Get the Security Badge

Show your commitment to LLM security with a GitHub-native status badge:

### One-Line Setup

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ballesty-Liam/llm-security-action/main/scripts/setup-badge.sh | bash
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Create the badge workflow (`.github/workflows/llm-security-badge.yml`)
- ‚úÖ Add the badge to your README
- ‚úÖ Create a default `llm-policy.yml` if needed

### Manual Badge Setup

Add to your README:
```markdown
[![LLM Security](https://github.com/Ballesty-Liam/llm-security-action/actions/workflows/llm-security-badge.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Ballesty-Liam/llm-security-action/actions/workflows/llm-security-badge.yml)
```

## Features

### üîç What It Scans

**API Key Detection**
- Common LLM provider prefixes (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, etc.)
- High-entropy strings that look like tokens (with entropy, character variety, and context filtering)
- Custom prefix patterns you define

**Rate Limiting**
- LLM API calls inside `for`/`while` loops
- Missing or too-short `sleep()` delays (only when API calls are present)
- Supports Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Go

**Input Sanitization**
- Direct or indirect user input flowing into LLM API calls
- Tainted variables, f-strings, or user input not passed through sanitizers
- AST-based analysis for Python, regex for JS/Go

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create `llm-policy.yml` in your repo root:

```yaml
# Enable/disable policies
policies:
  api-key-security: true    # Fail on exposed keys
  rate-limit: true         # Warn on missing rate limits
  input-sanitize: true     # Warn on unsanitized input

# Add custom API key prefixes
custom-api-key-prefixes: 
  - "mycompany-"
  - "internal-key-"

# Exclude files/directories
exclude_globs:
  - "node_modules/*"
  - ".env.example"
  - "tests/fixtures/*"

# Rate limit settings
rate-limit:
  languages: ["python", "javascript", "go"]
  warn-only: true
  min-sleep-seconds: 1.0

# Input sanitization settings
input-sanitize:
  languages: ["python", "javascript", "go"]
  warn-only: true
```

### üìä Action Outputs

Use scan results in your workflows:

```yaml
- uses: Ballesty-Liam/llm-security-action@v1
  id: security-scan
  
- name: Check results
  run: |
    echo "Status: ${{ steps.security-scan.outputs.status }}"
    echo "API Keys Found: ${{ steps.security-scan.outputs.api-key-violations }}"
    echo "Rate Limit Issues: ${{ steps.security-scan.outputs.rate-limit-warnings }}"
```

Available outputs:
- `status`: `passed`, `warning`, or `failed`
- `api-key-violations`: Number of exposed keys
- `rate-limit-warnings`: Number of rate limit issues  
- `input-sanitize-warnings`: Number of sanitization issues
- `badge-status`: Human-readable status with emoji
